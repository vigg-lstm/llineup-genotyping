This folder contains code for running the geostatistical modelling analyses described in Lynd et al. 2023, "LLIN Evaluation in Uganda Project (LLINEUP) – changes to insecticide resistance over the course of the trial." 
It uses the R-INLA package version INLA 23.01.12 (see www.r-inla.org and 
F Lindgren, H Rue, J Lindstrom, An explicit link between Gaussian fields and Gaussian Markov random fields: The stochastic partial differential equation approach. J R Stat Soc Ser B Stat Methodol 73, 423–498 (2011). 

R code uses R version 4.2.2.

Models can be run by typing inla_marker_frequency(data1) in R where data 1 is either:
kdr_frequenciesF_gamb2.csv
Cyp6p4_236M_frequencies_gamb2
Cyp4j5_43F_frequencies_gamb2
