"allocation_ALL.csv" is another version of Allocation.csv, that is coded slightly differently and includes more information on net type that was used (rather than intended). 

"llineup_location_id.csv" contains the district names (dname2019), sub-country names (ADM4_EN) and the coordinate centroid of each enumeration area (X and Y).
